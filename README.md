# What is this? #
A *very* primitive model-view-controller (MVC) based software architecture built on HTML5 and JavaScript (ECMAScript6). You are a two dimensional circle roaming around on a three dimensional torus. There are tiny circle food that grows over time; the larger the food, the larger you grow when you eat it. Eventually, you get too big and the game crashs though.
